 * @brief Centroidal Dynamics model relating forces to base accelerations.
 *
 * This class implements a simplified Centroidal dynamics model, a reduced
 * dimensional model, lying in terms of accuracy between a simple Linear
 * Inverted Pendulum model and a complex full
 * Centroidal (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-013-9341-4) or
 * Rigid-body-dynamics Model.
 *
 * This model makes the assumption that the motion of the limbs does not
 * incur significant momentum and can therefore be neglected. This eliminates
 * the often very nonnlinear dependency on joint angles and allows to express
 * all quantities in Cartesian space.
